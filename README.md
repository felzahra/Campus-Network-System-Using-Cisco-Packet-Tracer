# Campus-Network-System-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer








#### Objectives: 
To learn how to configure Campus Network System in Cisco Packet Tracer.

#### Theory:
**VLAN:** VLAN is a custom network which is created from one or more local area networks. It enables a group of devices available in multiple networks to be combined into one logical network. The result becomes a virtual LAN that is administered like a physical LAN. The full form of VLAN is defined as Virtual Local Area Network.

**Routing Information Protocol (RIP):** Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network. It is a distance-vector routing protocol that has an AD value of 120 and works on the Network layer of the OSI model. RIP uses port number 520.

#### Project Work Brief:
City University has large university which has two campuses situated 80 miles apart. The university’s students and staff are distributed in 4 faculties; these include the faculties of Health and Sciences; Business, Engineering/Computing; Art/Design. Each member and staff has a PC and students has access to PCs in the lab.

#### Requirements: 
	Create a network topology with the main components to support the following:

**•	Main Campus**

  o	Building A: Administrative staff of department of management, HR and Finance. The admin staff PCs distributed in the building offices and it is expected that they    will share some networking equipment. The Faculty of Business also situated in this building.
  
  o	Building B: Faculty of Engineering and Computing and Faculty of Art and Design.
  
  o	Building C: Students’ lab and IT department. The IT department hosts the University Web Server and other servers.
  
**•	City Campus**

  o	Faculty of Health and Sciences (Staff and students` are also situated in separated floors).
  
  	You will be expected to configure the core device and few end device to provide end-to-end connectivity on their networks.
  
•	Each Department/faculity is expected to on its own separate IP network.

•	The switches should be configured with appropriate VLANs and security settings.

•	RIPv2 will be used for internal and external network systems.

•	The device of both campus will be expected to acquired Static IP/ Dynamic IP Address. If we can send Dynamic IP Address then we need to used Router based DHCP Server.

**Implementation:**

Configuration of Campus Network System:

**Component:** In this network system I have used following components:

1.	Three 2911 Routers.
2.	Three Server-PT.
3.	Two 3650-24PS L3 Switch.
4.	Ten 2960 Switch.
5.	Ten PC-PT and Nine Printer-PT.
